# Yuvorix

Powerful legs and a chitinous skin allows Yuvorixes to burrow through earth. Yuvorixes' chitin are monochromatic, or in
rare cases they will have few details in a dark red to blue spectrum. They have a shell on their backs that goes into a
tough point behind their head. Their head are spherical at the bottom but flattens into an angled edge at the top, and
at both tips of the edge are horn-like antennas. The antennas acts as both a sensor for sound, and heat. At the bottom
of their head they have a tiny nose and a small mouth. Yuvorixes' extremities are all capable of retracting into their
shell, when they burrow.
