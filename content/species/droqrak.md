# Droqrak

These large heavy brutes come from a massive planet with very heavy gravity. They have thick leathery hair-less skin
ranging in colouration from deep beige to light purple. Their torso is shaped like an upside-down water droplet, with
thick legs going down into feet of the same thickness. They have thick arms with large four-fingered hands. Their heads
are a flat oval with large reptillian eyes, a wide mouth, and two vertical slits for breathing.
