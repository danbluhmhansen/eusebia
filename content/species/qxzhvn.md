# Qxzhvn

Lithe and lanky, the Qxzhvn (Kegsevin) are a hairless species with long arms and short legs. Their skin is leathery and
ranging in colour from white and pink to sandy and grey. Qxzhvn's torso are propertionally longer than their lower body,
and their arms even longer. Which means most Qxzhvn's arms will almost reach the ground when they stand tall. Their
heads are elongated and turns into a tail at the back. This tail runs the length of their torso, it starts out thick and
becomes thinner towards the tip. Qxzhvn have large oval eyes that are pitch black, two convex skin flaps they can lift
and breathe through, and a small mouth.
