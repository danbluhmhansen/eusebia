# Gercod

These small aquatic humanoids have smooth skin, that is capable of excreting a gooey substance to regulate body heat.
Their skin comes in almost any colouration imaginable, but is usually dominated by a particular colour. These colours
changes throughout their entire body, and is usually less pronounced, sometimes completely translucent, around their
joints. Their feet are shaped like fins, and their hands are webbed. They have three thin tails, about the same length
as their legs, that have wide, flat, and translucent tips. Their tails move slowly as if gliding through the air. Their
heads have human-like proportions, but they have no external ears, and their hair consists of appendages that resemble
fins. Their eyes are a solid colour, and their necks are covered in gills.
