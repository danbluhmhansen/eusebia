# Dim'oll

The Dim’oll are very similar to humans, except their skin are usually of a stronger colour like red, blue, violet, or
green, until they change it of course. They can change their skin colour on the fly, and even use it to turn invisible.
Atop of their head are two pointy horns that comes in many different forms, some stand straight up, or curl down along
their head, while others spiral out to the sides. Their horns are naturally a colour contrasting their skin, but most
Dim’oll makes them a unique style matching their personality. Otherwise they have mostly human-like facial features,
except for their eyes which are a unique set of colours that only changes if they actively wills them to. They also have
a long thick tail that whips around, and thins into a tip at the end.
