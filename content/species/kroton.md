# Kroton

Krotons have a tough scaled body, usually green, blue, or grey. Krotons feet have two clawed toes, and their calves are
arced backwards slightly. Their waist is thin, compared to their wide chest and shoulders. Krotons have horn-like fin
protrusions that start at the back of their head, and go all the way down their backs. Krotons heads are elongated with
four eyes along the sides, and a wide mouth at the bottom. Krotons have no nose, instead they both taste and smell using
their tongue. Most Krotons follow a mystical force they call, Qruvorn, decorating their bodies with a warpaint-like
symbolism. The most devout Krotons cover their two back eyes with a hood, as they are the ones to see the truth of
Qruvorn and must remain untainted by the sight of the world.
