# Aihmar

Aihmarians are a varied race similar to humans, although generally with light or fair skin colours. They have a green
hue around their joints that grow progressively more brown and bark-like as they age. Their skin is slightly coarse, but
is completely unblemished, and just below the surface it turns very tough. Their face are narrow, with human features,
except their pointed ears. Their hair is voluminous and comes in almost any colour. Similarly to their joints their hair
becomes stiffer and branch-like, but it first starts at old age.
