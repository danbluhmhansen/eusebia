# Ozot

Ozots are humanoids whose entire body is made up of an organic crystalline rock-hard material. Their body is of human
proportions, but their limbs are edged like crystals. Their heads contain two glowing stones for eyes, an edged
protrusion resembling a nose, but no mouth. Their hair is thin, but strong, translucent strings.
