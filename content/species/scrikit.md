# Scrikit

Scrikits are four-armed humanoids with soft skin, covered in rough short hair. Their hair comes in several different
colours and hues, orange, red, magenta, and browns. Their upper body is hunched, and their knees and ankles are
flexible, allowing them to easily bend down to use their clawed hands and feet to crawl. Their heads are elongated,
containing two eyes in the top half, and a small nose and mouth filled with pointed teeth in the bottom half.
